//
// The problem: needed a method to detect IE 10 and 11 for the purpose of working around an IE-specific
//   issue, namely what the offsetTheChartSegmentLabelsForIE method addresses.
//
// Attempted solutions: First I tried to use Modernizr https://modernizr.com/ to take a
//   feature-detection approach to working around the issue (as opposed to browser detection, which is not as
//   good as a feature detection approach). At the time I tried it, Modernizr offered no detector for CSS transforms
//   for SVG. The closest thing I found was this issue on the Modernizr repo which is still
//   open/unmerged/unresolved: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1985
//   Also looked into 3rd party libraries to handle this, most of which check the user agent string which is known to
//   be an imperfect method, and would have required us to add yet another 3rd party library which we would rather avoid anyways.
//
// The solution: a browser detection technique via `document.documentMode` which is present on
//   MS Internet Explorer 6 - 11 which is sufficient for this purpose. We actually just wanted to target IE 10-11
//  but this is fine: its a simple and reliable detection method and does not require the addition of any additional code/libraries.
//
import $ from "jquery"

const isIE = () => {
  return !!document.documentMode
}

//
// The problem: IE does not support CSS transforms on SVG elements, which is what we used to get those
//   bar chart segment labels rendered at a 45ยบ angle in modern web browsers. That does not work in IE 10/11.
//
// Attempted solutions: tried to do this in CSS which would have been better and easier with the IE-specific
//  stylesheet that we already have, but could not get these offsets to take effect via CSS for IE.
//
// The solution: In conjunction with the writing mode change in the IE-specific stylesheet to render these
//   elements sideways at 90ยบ, apply X and Y offsets here via JavaScript to the SVG nodes (TEXT nodes in IE).
//   The offsets are arbitrary, just what aligned with the bar chart segments in IE 11 and looked decent on IE 11.
//
const offsetTheChartSegmentLabelsForIE = (chartistDomContainer) => {
  if (!isIE() || !chartistDomContainer) {
    return
  }

  const chartLabelEls = chartistDomContainer.querySelectorAll(
    ".ct-label.ct-horizontal"
  )
  const chartBarEls = chartistDomContainer.querySelectorAll("line.ct-bar")
  chartLabelEls.forEach((chartLabelEl, idx) => {
    const offsetX = -4
    const offsetY = 5
    const $chartLabelEl = $(chartLabelEl)
    const barXcoord = parseInt($(chartBarEls[idx]).attr("x1"))
    const barYcoord = parseInt($(chartBarEls[idx]).attr("y1"))
    $chartLabelEl.attr("x", barXcoord + offsetX).attr("y", barYcoord + offsetY)
  })
}

//
// The problem: IE does not support CSS transforms on SVG elements
//
// The solution: Set the SVG PATH node's transform attribute via JS
//
const sizeTheSvgForIE = () => {
  if (!isIE()) {
    return
  }

  $("svg.bar-chart path").attr("transform", "scale(2.5)")
}

export { isIE, offsetTheChartSegmentLabelsForIE, sizeTheSvgForIE }
