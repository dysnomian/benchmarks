// This is the fix for the footer floating over content at some apparently random
// point mid-page. Taken from: https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/

  flex: 1 0 auto;

footer {
  flex: 1;

// This is to handle the bar chart segment labels, which are rotated -45ยบ for other browsers,
// to just display as rotated at 90ยบ via the writing direction CSS directive.

.card.plan .ct-label.ct-horizontal {

}
.ct-chart-bar {
  // needs more bottom margin to allow the angled labels to display w/o cut off
  margin: 0 0 60px 0 !important;
}

//
// This is to fix the problem of the navbar, for smaller screen sizes when the toggler is displayed,
// and when the toggler is used to expand the menu, that the .container height does not expand along
// with its content, resulting in the navbar's menu content being cut off at the top and bottom on IE.

  flex-shrink: 0;

/*
 * a flex basis of 0 does not work in IE11 when the flex-direction is set to column.
 * for more info, please refer to: https://makandracards.com/makandra/54644-do-not-use-flex-1-or-flex-basis-0-inside-flex-direction-column-when-you-need-to-support-ie11
 * this fixes the bug reported in: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/171365497, but is applicable wherever we use a flex-direction of column, because with the default
 * bootstrap setting of flex-basis: 0, child elements will have a height of 0 and not be positioned correctly
